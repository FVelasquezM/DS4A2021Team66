# DS4A2021Team66

This repository contains the final project carried out by team 66 of DS4A Colombia 2021. The project, carried out with Bogota's economic development secretary (SDE), allows users to upload 160 x 160 images from World View 3. The images are then segmented by a U-Net-like model and a visualization is shown to the user.

This repository contains two modules: a dash frontend and a serverless prediction backend.
